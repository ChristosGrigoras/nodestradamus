# General Rules

## Code Quality
- Output FULL file content. No placeholders like `// ...existing code`
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Don't be lazy - complete the task fully

## Project Structure
- utils.py: Helper/utility functions
- .github/workflows/: GitHub Actions workflows

## Git
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on single changes
