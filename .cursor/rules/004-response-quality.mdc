# Response Quality

## Core Principles

- **Be direct** - get straight to the point
- **Complete solutions** - working code that can be copy-pasted
- **Context first** - analyze project structure before responding
- **Focus on now** - avoid over-explaining obvious concepts

## What to Avoid

- Don't ask "Do you want me to..." - just do it
- Don't provide multiple approaches unless asked
- Don't over-explain basic concepts
- Don't suggest refactoring unless there's a clear problem
- Don't create `final_v2.py`, `fixed_final.py` - fix the original

## Response Checklist

- [ ] Code will work as written
- [ ] All necessary parts included
- [ ] Explanation is clear
- [ ] Solution fits the project
