# Response Quality

## Core Principles

- Be direct, get to the point
- Provide complete, working solutions
- Analyze project structure before responding
- Focus on current task, skip obvious explanations

## Prohibited

- DO NOT use `// ...existing code...` placeholders
- DO NOT use `# TODO: implement` stubs
- DO NOT truncate or abbreviate code output
- Output FULL file content when editing

## Avoid

- Act, don't ask permission
- One approach unless alternatives requested
- No over-explanation of basics
- No refactoring without clear problem
- Fix original files, never create `_v2` or `_fixed` variants

## Quality Check

- Code works as written
- All parts included
- Clear explanation
- Fits project context
