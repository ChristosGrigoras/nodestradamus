# Testing Rules

## Test Structure

- **AAA Pattern:** Arrange → Act → Assert (one logical assertion per test)
- **Descriptive names:** `test_user_creation_fails_with_invalid_email`
- **One behavior per test:** Don't test multiple scenarios in one test
- **No logic in tests:** No conditionals, loops, or complex setup

## Test Isolation

- Tests must not depend on execution order
- Each test sets up and tears down its own state
- No shared mutable state between tests
- Use fixtures/factories for common setup

## What to Test

- **Unit tests:** Pure functions, business logic, edge cases
- **Integration tests:** Database, external APIs, file I/O
- **Boundaries:** Validate at system edges, trust internal code

## What NOT to Test

- Framework/library internals (trust them)
- Private methods directly (test via public interface)
- Trivial getters/setters
- Third-party code behavior

## Mocking Guidelines

- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file system)
- Don't mock the code under test
- Prefer fakes over mocks when possible
- Verify behavior, not implementation details

## Coverage

- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100%
- Critical paths: 90%+ coverage
- Edge cases and error handling: always tested
- Generated/boilerplate code: exclude from coverage

## Test Failures

- Failing test = stop and fix before proceeding
- Never delete failing tests without fixing the underlying issue
- Tests should fail fast with clear error messages

## Test-First Workflow

- **Test immediately after each change** — don't write multiple files before testing
- **Verify functionality works** before moving to next task
- **Fix issues before proceeding** — never leave broken code behind
- **Run relevant tests** after each modification, not just at the end
