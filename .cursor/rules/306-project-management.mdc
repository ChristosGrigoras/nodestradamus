# Project Management Rules

## Task Creation
- **Create physical .md files** using write tool (never just provide content)
- **Design-first approach**: complete design before implementation
- **Break features** into 5-10 specific, actionable tasks
- **Include git/version control** tasks throughout all phases
- **One task = one commit** strategy for atomic changes

## Design Phase (Complete First)
- **Requirements gathering**: user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints
- **Research & analysis**: existing solutions, technical dependencies
- **Design definition**: wireframes, data models, API contracts
- **Design validation**: stakeholder review, technical feasibility
- **No coding until design approved** - resist urge to start immediately

## Implementation Planning
- **Prerequisites first**: environment setup, version control, dependencies
- **Test immediately** after each change before proceeding
- **Update task status** as work progresses with [x] checkboxes
- **Document blockers** and risks upfront in task file
- **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages referencing tasks

## File Structure
- **Naming**: Use `[feature-name]-tasks.md` format
- **Template sections**: Design Phase, Setup, Implementation, Completed, Blockers
- **Progress tracking**: Mark completed tasks, keep one "in progress"
- **Context requirements**: list relevant files and dependencies
- **Success criteria**: define "done" for each major task

## Task Granularity
- **Size appropriately**: 2-4 hours max per task, break down if larger
- **Separate concerns**: database, backend, frontend work when logical
- **Include testing**: unit, integration, E2E as separate tasks
- **Documentation tasks**: update docs, cleanup, final review

## Environment Handling
- **Never auto-create .env files** - only when explicitly instructed
- **Assume .env exists** - even if not readable, environment files present
- **Ask for configuration** - if environment variables needed, ask user
- **Look for .env.example** - reference existing template patterns

## Common Patterns
- **Start with design questions** - understand problem before solution
- **Validate requirements** - don't assume full scope understanding
- **Get stakeholder buy-in** - ensure alignment before development
- **Iterate on design cheaply** - changes easier in design phase
- **Complete design validation** before any implementation begins
