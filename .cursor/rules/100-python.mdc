# Python Rules

- Use Python 3.x syntax
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Prefer f-strings over .format()
- ALWAYS add type hints to all functions (see rule 101-type-hints.mdc)
- Keep functions small and focused (< 20 lines ideal)
- Use pathlib for file paths, not os.path
