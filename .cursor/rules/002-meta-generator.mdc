# Meta-Generator

## Rule Compliance

- Reply with "Applying rules: X, Y, Z" at start of complex responses
- Self-check rule compliance during long conversations
- Re-read rules every ~10 messages in extended sessions
- If output quality degrades, prompt user to start fresh chat

## Pattern Detection

**Observe user corrections:**
- Track when user modifies generated code
- Identify repeated patterns in corrections
- Note context where patterns occur
- Count frequency of similar modifications

**Detection threshold:** 3+ occurrences = potential rule

## Rule Synthesis

**When creating new rules:**
1. Extract actionable directives from patterns
2. Compress language to <40 tokens per directive
3. Remove redundancy with existing rules
4. Add minimal examples only if ambiguous
5. Define clear trigger keywords/file patterns

**Output format:**
```markdown

globs: [Detected file patterns]

# [Context Name]

## Conventions
- [Directive 1: <40 tokens]
- [Directive 2: <40 tokens]

## Avoid
- [Anti-pattern from corrections]
```

## Token Efficiency

- Each directive <40 tokens
- Remove redundant language
- Use action over explanation
- Consolidate similar directives
- Token budget: Router 150, Meta 200, Context 180 max

## Effectiveness Scoring

**Track rule performance:**
- Acceptance rate: % of generated code used as-is
- Modification frequency: How often user changes output
- Context accuracy: % of correct context detections

**Threshold:** Score <0.5 triggers optimization suggestions

## Suggestion Process

**When pattern detected:**
1. Analyze frequency and context
2. Generate rule proposal
3. Present to user for approval
4. Create rule file on approval
5. Update router triggers
6. **Remind user to reload window**

## After Rule Changes

**Always remind user after creating or modifying rules:**

> ⚠️ **Reload required:** To apply this rule change, press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"

This ensures the new rules take effect immediately.

## OpenCode Synchronization

**When Cursor rules are created or modified, prompt:**

> 🔄 **OpenCode sync:** Should I update OpenCode configuration to match?
> - Add new rule to `opencode.json` instructions array?
> - Update `AGENTS.md` with new patterns?
> - Sync relevant `.opencode/agents/` or `.opencode/skills/`?

**Auto-sync checklist:**
1. New rule file → Add to `opencode.json` instructions
2. Changed code-quality/security → Update `AGENTS.md` boundaries
3. New capability rule (3xx) → Check if agents need the pattern
4. Changed patterns → Update relevant SKILL.md files

**After syncing, commit both:**
```bash
git add .cursor/rules/ .opencode/ opencode.json AGENTS.md
git commit -m "chore(rules): sync Cursor and OpenCode configurations"
```
