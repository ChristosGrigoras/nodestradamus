# Stale Documentation

This document contains broken references for testing.

## Broken File Links

- [deleted_file.py](deleted_file.py) - This file doesn't exist
- [old/module.ts](old/module.ts) - Removed directory
- See [nonexistent.rs](nonexistent.rs) for details

## Broken Code References

The `deleted_function` was removed in v2.0.

Use `OldClassName` for legacy support.

## Broken Code Blocks

```python:removed/file.py
def deprecated():
    pass
```

```1:5:nonexistent/path.ts
export function old() {}
```
